# Introduction 
Mobile app that tells a GoPro to record and then starts recording GPS data from the handset. This data can be then used to overlay GPS and speed data on footage later.

A Python script is also supplied that will take the JSON supplied by the mobile app and the video from the GoPro in order to overlay the speed and altitude onto the video.

***Note:*** Your phone must be connected to the GoPro via WiFi to work.

# Getting Started

1.  Add Recording Name and hit 'Record'.
2.	Go to the 'Recordings' page and open the Recording.
3.	Hit 'Process Video' and retrieve the created JSON.
4.	*(optional)* Use the created JSON and GoPro footage with the *TextVid* Python script to overlay speed and altitude.
