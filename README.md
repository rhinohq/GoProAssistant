# Introduction 
Mobile app that tells a GoPro and then starts recording GPS data from the handset. This data can be then used to overlay GPS and speed data on footage later.

A Python script is also supplied that will take the JSON supplied by the mobile app and the video from the GoPro and overlay the speed and altitude onto the video.

# Getting Started

1.  Add Recording Name and hit 'Record'.
2.	Go to 'Recordings' page and open the Recording.
3.	Hit 'Process Video' and retrieve the created JSON.
4.	*(optional)* Use the created JSON and GoPro footage with the TextVid python script to overlay speed and altitude.
